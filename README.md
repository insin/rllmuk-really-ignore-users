## After installing

### Globally ignored users

Visit the forum's [Ignored Users page](https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/ignore/) and the extension will synchronise itself with your global ignored users settings.

The following will now be hidden in topics:

- "You've chosen to ignore content byâ€¦" placeholders for posts by ignored users
- Posts which quote an ignored user
- Posts which @-mention an ignored user

### Ignoring users in specific topics

The extension adds a new "Topic Ignore" control to user profile cards - hover over a user's name and click it to ignore them in the current topic only.

The extension also adds a new section to the [Ignored Users page](https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/ignore/) to manage users ignored in specific topics - click "Stop ignoring" here to stop ignoring a user in that topic.

Please remind your fellow forumites to quote or @-mention ignore-worthy users when engaging with them.
